# MachineLearningAlgorithms
In this reprository i have only included some basic Machine Learning Algorithms like KNN, K-Means, Decision Trees, Random Forest(which i included in Decision Tree file as RF), PCA, Linear Regression and Logistic Regression
### 1. KNN(K-Nearest Neighbour)
### 2. K-Means
### 3. Decision Trees
### 4. Random Forest
### 5. PCA(Dimensionality reduction technique)
### 6. Linear Regression
### 7. Logistic Regression
### 8. Web Scrapping


For KNN i have used load digits datasets from sklearn and for every algorithm(KNN, K-Means, Decision Trees, Random Forest, PCA) in the files i also mentioned how to deal with it using SK-LEARN.
For Decision Trees i have used titanic dataset and for PCA the popular MNIST dataset
And for Linear Regression and Logistic regression I also included code using sklearn
For Linear Regression i have also used Genetic Algorithm

In web scrapping i scraped datatau and wikipedia like websites.
