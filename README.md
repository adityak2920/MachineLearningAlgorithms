# MachineLearningAlgorithms
In this reprository i have only included some basic Machine Learning Algorithms like KNN, K-Means, Decision Trees, Random Forest(which i included in Decision Tree file as RF) and PCA
# 1. KNN(K-Nearest Neighbour)
# 2. K-Means
# 3. Decision Trees
# 4. Random Forest
# 5. PCA(Dimensionality reduction technique)
