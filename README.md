# MachineLearningAlgorithms
In this reprository i have only included some basic Machine Learning Algorithms like KNN, K-Means, Decision Trees, Random Forest(which i included in Decision Tree file as RF) and PCA
# 1. KNN(K-Nearest Neighbour)
# 2. K-Means
# 3. Decision Trees
# 4. Random Forest
# 5. PCA(Dimensionality reduction technique)

For KNN i have used load digits datasets from sklearn and for every algorithm(KNN, K-Means, Decision Trees, Random Forest, PCA) in the files i also mentioned how to deal with it using SK-LEARN.
For Decision Trees and PCA i have used the popular MNIST dataset
